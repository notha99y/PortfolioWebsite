I am an AI Engineer at [Defence Science and Technology Agency](https://www.dsta.gov.sg/home). I am also a part-time Master of Technology (Knowledge Engineering) Student at [Institute of System Science](https://www.iss.nus.edu.sg/), NUS. <br>

I love a good read and I am an avid Tennis player. <br>

I also support Man Utd (although they have been bad in recent years), and a fan of One Piece. <br>

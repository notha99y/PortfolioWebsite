# What is Semantic Segmentation
Semantic segmentation can be seen as the next "level-up" from the typical image classification examples, which are often used as a "Hello World" projects to introduce Deep Learning, like the famous [cifar-10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) and [mnist](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) datesets. The goal of Semantic Segmentation is classify each pixels in an image and is one of the fundamental tasks in computer vision.

# Satellite Scheduling Problem
Efficient satellite mission planning has always been a key aspect of the Ground Operations. <br>
The task of satellite mission planning has always been placed onto a human operator to plan accurately and efficiently to meet all of the requirements provided. <br>
This manual tasking is tedious and requires high level of meticulosity <br>
An automatic satellite scheduler can use Search Algorithms to optimize and quicken this process

# Problem Formulation
The scheduling problem of an earth observation satellite is a large and difficult combinatorial optimization problem. <br>
Thankfully, such a scheduling problem is well-studied with numerous papers stating different problem formulations. <br>
Some notable formulations are the generalized knapsack formulation, which is well-known to be NP-hard, adopted in [2]. <br>
In [3], it discusses the possibility of using linear integer programming formulation with CPLEX or as a constraint satisfaction problem formulation. <br>
For this demo, we shall adopt a Constraint-Optimization Problem (COP) formulation using Object Oriented Programming(OOP). <br>

COP refers to a set of problems that requires the optimization of an objective function with respect to some variables in the presence of constraints on those variables. <br>

# Object Used
The objects used are summarized in the class table below. <br>
The classes Imaging Missions, Satellites and Ground Stations are user inputs designed by the users to fulfil the mission requirements. <br>
Imaging Opportunities and Downlink are derived classes which the programme would automatically generate after the users has specified the Tasks and Resources he/she wants to simulate for a given Scenario time frame. <br>

$$ Score_i = k_a a_i + k_b b_i $$

## To run
1. Create the Resource and Imaging Mission by changing and running the creating_IM_params.py and creating_resource_params.py file (you can skip this step to run the sample simulation I have created.)
2. Open the main.py file and uncomment out the algorithm you want to use. Run it.
3. This would generate 2 .csv files per orbit (Results and Remaining targets)
4. To plot, open the subplotting.py file and change the numberOfOrbits variable to the same as the last number of the orbit.

## Plots
![plots](plotting_results.png)
The Mission is simulated to complete in 8 orbits. The plot is taken in the frame with respect to the satellite orbit path.

### Mission Requirements
- 20 distinct point targets scattered at Near Equatorial Orbit.
- All to be imaged twice
- All to be imaged using an Optical Sensor
- The maximum look angle is set to be 45deg
- Priorities were set to be all equal

### Resources
- One Satellite with an Optical Sensor and a carry capacity of 8 images.
- Satellite agility was modelled have an average angular speed of 0.0628 rad/s
- One Ground Station at
